This project is inpired by [[http://moviebarcode.tumblr.com/][moviebarcode]].

It contains a simple shell script which can compress a whole movie into a
single moviebarcode picture.

It prefers Linux as a test platform since the necessary tools such as bash,
[[http://www.graphicsmagick.org/][graphicsmagick]], [[http://www.graphicsmagick.org/][bc]], [[http://www.ffmpeg.org/][ffmpeg]] is running better on Linux rather than on Windows.

If you are a Mac OS X user, maybe you need to get [[http://brew.sh/][homebrew]] to install the
aformentioned tools.

The following picture is the moviebarcode for [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301727/][Winged Migration]].
